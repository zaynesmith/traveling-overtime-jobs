Minimal Next.js starter to verify GitHub â†’ Vercel deployment.

## Database migrations

- Run `npm run prisma:migrate` during local development when you need to create a new migration.
- Run `npm run prisma:migrate:deploy` in production environments (for example, via CI/CD) to apply pending migrations. This replaces the previous `prisma db push` workflow.

## Environment variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in both `.env.local` and Vercel's environment variables to use your pooled Supabase connection string in the format `postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:6543/<db>?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1`. Prisma requires the `pgbouncer=true` and `connection_limit=1` query parameters to work correctly with Supabase's connection pooling.
These variables are required for both development (`npm run dev`) and production builds (`npm run build`).

## Supabase alignment checks

Run `npm run check:supabase` to verify that the live Supabase schema and the repository's routing logic stay in sync. The script:

- performs read-only queries against `user`, `employerprofile`, and `jobseekerprofile` to confirm required columns, constraints, and role consistency;
- inspects the authentication and registration pages to ensure dashboard redirects are aligned with the stored user roles.

Set `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) before executing the command. The script only issues `SELECT` statements and will exit if the required database connection details or Prisma dependencies are missing.

## Routing & Roles

- The public jobs directory lives at `/jobs` and accepts optional query parameters `q`, `location`, `trade`, and `payMin` to pre-filter results.
- Employers can create accounts at `/employer/register` and manage their workspace from `/employer/dashboard` after signing in.
- Jobseekers can create accounts at `/jobseeker/register` and access their tools from `/jobseeker/dashboard` once logged in.
